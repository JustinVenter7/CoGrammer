Hi Student :)

I found that your JOptionPane was working correctly, the problem was your while loop on line 8.
The reason why your '!=' (not equal to) did not work is because this is only used 
to compare two of the same objects. For example:

int i = 10;
int x = 15;

if(i != 10)
	{
		//this will enter the if statement
	}

 To compare different object, use '.equals() as follows: ' if(!choice.equals("Bob")) '

Also another note, it is always important to keep proper spacing in your code to keep 
it presentable and easy to read. So in line 5 your 'System.out...' can all be on one line, as well as 
the JOptionPane on line 6.


Below is my reworked code. I was not sure if I needed to include this, so I did just in case.
(Please note that the above mentioned line numbers do not apply here)

package do_whilePassword;
import java.util.*;  
import javax.swing.*;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) 
    {
        String choice = ""; 
        do {
        //System.out.println( "Enter today's number from the menu:" ); 
        choice = JOptionPane.showInputDialog("Please enter in a password");
       }
        while(!choice.equals("John"));
    }
}
