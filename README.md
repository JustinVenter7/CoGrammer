Explanation:
I am terribly sorry, I know that my test is not 100% completed, I am afraid unfortunate and unforeseen circumstances has come forth as I gained knowledge of this test. Everything I completed here I did in one night and one morning. I did as much as I could, but I could not finish everything, and I am unfortunately leaving town for a few days as soon as I submit this. Reason why I am saying this is because I want to explain that this is not my best quality work, nor do I ever not finish something. Unfortunately, I had limited time to complete this test. I would be happy to take another test next week if necessary as things will be normalized again.
